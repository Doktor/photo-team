# **Photo Room**

The Photo Room will be open several times during the convention. We have a professional studio setup and we'd love to take photos of you and your friends\! Everyone is welcome to have their photo taken: it's free and a fursuit or costume is not required. You don't need any experience with posing; our staff will help you get ready for the camera. We'll have some themed props, but you're welcome to bring your own props as well.

We welcome individuals and small groups of up to eight people\! We'll call each party in on a first come, first serve basis. When it's busy, we may limit the number of photos per party to keep the line moving and reduce wait times. If you want more photos, you're welcome to line up again, or return when it's less busy. *Hint: the Thursday session is always the least busy\!*

It's free to have your photo taken, but we'd greatly appreciate it if you supported our charities\! You can find details about our charities [here](https://www.anthronewengland.com/about/charity/).

## **Hours of operation**

The Photo Room is located in the Faneuil Room on the Mezzanine Level (Floor 2, on the same side of the hotel as the Grand Ballroom).

* Thursday: 6–10 PM   
* Friday: 12–4 PM  
* Sunday: 1–5 PM

## **Prints**

In addition to our studio setup, we also have a professional printing setup\! After we take your photos in the Photo Room, we can print them so you can have a physical souvenir to take home. Prints are available any time the Photo Room is open. Unfortunately, we cannot offer prints after the Photo Room closes on Sunday.

Prints are available for free, but we suggest a charity donation of $1 per print. All money collected will be donated directly to our charities. You can find details about our charities [here](https://www.anthronewengland.com/about/charity/).

If you don't have a convenient way of taking the print with you, we're happy to hold on to it; just return during operating hours to pick it up. After the Photo Room closes on Sunday, any prints that were not picked up will be left on a table outside the Photo Room.

*Note: the print service is subject to availability of materials.*

## **Digital copies**

Digital copies of the photos will be posted online 1–2 months after the convention. Follow the ANE Twitter for updates\!
