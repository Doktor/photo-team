# **Photo Room**

The Photo Room offers all ANE attendees a premium photo experience — free of charge\!

All attendees are welcome\! You're not required to have a fursuit or costume, and you don't need any experience with posing. Our staff will help you get ready for the camera. We also have a large selection of props to spice up your photos\! (We invite you to bring your own props as well.) 

We welcome individuals and groups of up to 12 people. We accept visitors on a first come first served basis. When there's a line, we may limit the number of photos to keep the line moving and reduce wait times. If you want more photos, you're welcome to line up again, or return when it's less busy.

It's 100% free to have your photo taken in the Photo Room, but we'd greatly appreciate it if you made a donation to the ANE charities, Wings of the Dawn and Queer Scouts\! You can learn more about the charities [here](https://www.anthronewengland.com/about/charity/).
