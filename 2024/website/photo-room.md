# **Photo Room**

The Photo Room is a photo studio where you can have your photo taken. Everyone is welcome to visit the Photo Room\! It's free, you're not required to have a fursuit or costume, and you don't need any experience with posing. Our staff will help you get ready for the camera. We'll have some themed props and you're welcome to bring your own props as well.

We welcome individuals and groups of up to 12 people. We accept visitors on a first come first served basis. If there's a line, we may limit the number of photos per person/group to keep the line moving and reduce wait times. If you want more photos, you're welcome to line up again, or return when it's less busy.

It's free to have your photo taken in the Photo Room, but we'd greatly appreciate it if you made a donation to the ANE charities, Wings of the Dawn and Youth on Fire\! You can read more about the charities [here](https://www.anthronewengland.com/about/charity/).
